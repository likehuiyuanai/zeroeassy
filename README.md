# Zeroeassy
This project will be continuously updated
The 1.0 code was provided by Hu Zhehan, a primary school student in Chongqing, China. Comments are welcome.
On October 1st, the entire Jupyter Notebook code for Zeroeasy 1.0 was released for easy reproduction on machine learning platforms such as Google Colab, AWS, and Alibaba Cloud.
The 1.0 version is based on the transformation of the Big Brother Andrej Karpathy charRNN project and can be trained on Pytorch. I have also improved some of the slow training speed issues by nearly 3.7%. The training time for the Three Body Dark Forest on the NVIDIA MX450 GPU is only 11 hours.
Moreover, I have improved the original code to only use English for training, so that it can be trained in Chinese.
The WEB UI version will be publicly available for easy use before October 8th。
本项目将持续更新
1.0代码由中国重庆小学生胡哲涵提供，欢迎提出意见。
10月1日 公开Zeroeassy 1.0全部jupyter notebook代码，便于大家在Google Colab、AWS、阿里云上面的机器学习平台的jupyter notebook进行复现。
1.0版本基于大佬Andrej Karpathy charRNN项目改造而来，可以在pytorch上面进行训练，而且由我改进了部分训练速度慢的问题，提高速度近3.7%，在NVIDIA MX450 GPU上对三体黑暗森林的训练时间仅用11小时。
并且，我将原本代码的只能使用英文训练改进，使其可以使用中文训练。
10月8日之前将公开WEB UI版本方便使用
